# Keller Box

Implementation of the Keller Box scheme for a system of boundary layer PDE's which arise through from the 
stretching of a flat sheet, coupled to an energy equation, accounting for the role of viscous dissipation.

A full derivation of the scheme may be found in the pdf. 

To run the code simply run the script 
Crane_Keller_Box_inverse_viscosity.m
